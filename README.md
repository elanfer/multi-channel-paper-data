# Multi-Channel Data Set
This Repository contains data from a measurement campaign in order to improve the proximity estimation. The basic idea is to improve the estimation by combining Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) signals with BLE signals. Parts of these data were collected during a [master thesis](https://github.com/elanfer/msc-thesis), others during regular research. The paper containing results was submitted to an IEEE conference and is currently under review. Measurement setup and details are described in detail in the thesis. A brief description will be published in this repository soon.

## Devices
- Raspberry Pi 4b (Pi) (**Receiver** and sender)
- Apple iPhone 6S (iPhone) (Sender)
- OnePlus Nord N10 5G (OnePlus) (Sender)

## Environments
- Office room
- Bus
- Train 
- Outdoors in an empty parking lot

## Settings
- Measurement section (Only one device sending at stable distance)
- Scenarios (All three senders active, from different positions/orientations, at stable distance)

## Data fields
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| distance| Distance between sender and receiver in cm |
| rssiBLE | Raw RSSI in dBm for the BLE advertisement |
| rssi24  | Raw RSSI in dBm for the IEEE 802.11 2.4GHz probe requests |
| freq24  | Frequency in MHz for the IEEE 802.11 2.4GHz probe requests |
| rssi5   | Raw RSSI in dBm for the IEEE 802.11 5Hz probe requests | 
| freq5   | Frequency in MHz for the IEEE 802.11 5GHz probe requests |
| y       | Distance classification into *very_close*, *close*, and *safe* (in accordance to GAEN proximity estimation) |
